# Sampling

This README file describes various sampling techniques used in machine learning
models. It provides an overview of the different sampling methods available and their
benefits, along with examples of how they can be used in various machine learning
applications. The file also includes code snippets and explanations of how to implement
the different sampling techniques in popular machine learning libraries. This resource
aims to help developers and data scientists choose the appropriate sampling method for
their specific use case and improve the accuracy of their machine learning models.
